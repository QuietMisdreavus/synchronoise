/// A synchronization primitive that signals when its count reaches zero.
///
/// With a `CountdownEvent`, it's possible to cause one thread to wait on a set of computations
/// occurring in other threads by making the other threads interact with the counter as they
/// perform their work.
///
/// The main limitation of a CountdownEvent is that once its counter reaches zero (even by starting
/// there), any attempts to update the counter will return `CountdownError::AlreadySet` until the
/// counter is reset by calling `reset` or `reset_to_count`.
///
/// `CountdownEvent` is a port of [System.Threading.CountdownEvent][src-link] from .NET (also
/// called [`CountDownLatch`][java-src] in Java).

///
/// # Example
///
/// This example uses a `CountdownEvent` to make the "coordinator" thread sleep until all of its
/// "worker" threads have finished. Each thread calls `signal.decrement()` to signal to the Event
/// that its work has completed. When the last thread does this (and brings the counter to zero),
/// the "coordinator" thread wakes up and prints `all done!`.
